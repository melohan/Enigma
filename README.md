# Enigma
HEIG Project 2020 INF2

The purpose of this application is to simulate Enigma machine mechanism.
The Enigma machine is a cipher device.

The basic principle of the Enigma machines designed by Scherbius is based on the use of rotors that transform the clear alphabet into the cipher alphabet.
